# Introduction

This documentation aims to provide all the information you need to work with our API.

<aside>As you scroll, you'll see code examples for working with the API in different programming languages in the dark area to the right (or as part of the content on mobile).
You can switch the language used with the tabs at the top right (or from the nav menu at the top left on mobile).</aside>

<aside class="warning">PS: the interactive requests will always fail because I haven't hosted the API anywhere.
If you want to see them in action, clone <a href="https://github.com/shalvah/TheCensorshipAPI">the repo</a> to your machine and run <code>php artisan serve</code>.</aside>
