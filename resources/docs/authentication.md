# Authenticating requests

This API is authenticated by sending an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {your-token}"`**.

You can retrieve your API key by screaming into the void, <em>"I AM READYYYYYYYYY!"</em> A genie will appear and ask you a few questions to determine if you are worthy for the API key. <aside class="success">Okay, seriously, this is just some text to demonstrate Scribe. ðŸ™‚ The text in the first paragraph in this "Authentication" section is generated by Scribe from the parameters specified in `scribe.auth`. The rest of the text is provided by you in `scribe.auth.extra_info`.</aside>
