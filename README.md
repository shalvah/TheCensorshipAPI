# TheCensorshipAPI

So, what's this fucking project, huh? Well, it's a shitload of crap I thought up because I needed a dummy project I could use as a fucking playground while working on [this API documentation tool](https://github.com/mpociot/laravel-apidoc-generator/). Plus, I can use it to stay up-to-date on my Laravel-fu.

<small>Don't like all the swearing? Well, piss off and fuck you.</small>

## Documentation
It's an API for maintaining a list of "bad words" and lets you censor anything you like that contains bad words. Currently, there's piss-poor securiy, so any dumb fuck can modify the list. 

Examples of bad words: "dog", "person", "food". You know what they are, fuckface.

That's all the documentation you're going to get (apart from the API docs, which are a work in progress). So fuck off and don't be a cunt.

## Contributing
Read the fucking code and figure your own shit out. There's tests and stuff, I guess,  but who gives a fuck? Oh yes, I do.

If you're interested, there's a [project board](https://github.com/shalvah/TheCensorshipAPI/projects/1) and maybe a [couple of issues](https://github.com/shalvah/TheCensorshipAPI/issues).
