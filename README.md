# TheCensorshipAPI

This project is a bunch of crap I cooked up to test [this API documentation tool](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/) I maintain. Also to stay up-to-date on my Laravel-fu.üòê


## Documentation
I hate bad words. And people using words that I don't like them to use. And people, generally. So I made this.

[Anyway, here's the goddamned API documentation](https://shalvah.me/TheCensorshipAPI).


## License
Don't fucking bother me.
